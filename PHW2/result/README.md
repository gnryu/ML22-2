<h2> Note </h2>

There are so many cases: combination of scaling methods, encoding methods, combination of features, and number of clusters for each of the four models <br>

Since it takes a long time to run on one model, we created a file separately. DBSCAN and EM are implemented in one file, and Clarans is divided into two files to visualize. <br>
(Clarans takes too long to learn, so we only use 500 samples of total dataset for Clarans) <br><br>

So a total of four files were created as follows.
- K-means
- DBSCAN_EM
- Clarans_1
- Clarans_2

<br>

The capacity of .ipynb file is too large to be rendered. Please refer to the attached Google Colaboratory link if you want to see the visualization results.
