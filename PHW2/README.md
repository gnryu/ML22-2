<h1> Programming Homework 2 </h1>



There are so many cases: combination of scaling methods, encoding methods, combination of features, and number of clusters for each of the four models <br>
Since it takes a long time to run on one model, we created a file separately for each model. (DBSCAN and EM are implemented in one file, and Clarans is divided into two files to visualized.) <br>

So a total of four files were created as follows.
- K-means
- DBSCAN_EM
- Clarans_1
- Clarans_2

<strong>
For K-means, DBSCAN, and EM, we also upload .py file because the capacity of .ipynb file is too large to be uploaded. Please refer to the attached Google Colaboratory link if you want to see the results.

- K-means: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tu4xIGmTH_WeTAo6XGiNa38Ac9ICWtYK/view?usp=sharing
- DBSCAN_EM: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12yUzIZCvy1VM-oIy4H_9fHlY9LiF42J7/view?usp=sharing
</strong>

We also upload the full code of .py file containing all four models under the name of FullCode.py
